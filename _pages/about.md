About me
-------
I'm Alex, I graduated with a PhD in chemical engineering in 2020 and have been a data scientist with Capital One since January 2020. 

I wear many hats - 

* Data scientist
* Molecular modeler
* Computational chemist
* Chemical engineer


About this blog
--------
I like to combine open-source software and open-source data.
This isn't my 9-5 job, so don't expect any groundbreaking results, but something interesting may catch your eye.
While I'm open to being wrong, I'm also open to discussion from visitors!


You can reach me at any of the links on the sidebar
