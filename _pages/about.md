About me and this blog
-------
I'm Alex, a data scientist/molecular modeler/computational chemist/chemical engineer.
I like to combine open-source software and open-source data.
This isn't my 9-5 job, so don't expect any groundbreaking results, but something interesting may catch your eye.
While I'm open to being wrong, I'm also open to discussion from visitors!


A quick rundown:
- (2016-2020) PhD in chemical engineering 
- (2020-2021) Data scientist at Capital One
- (2021-present) Data scientist at Merck


You can reach me at any of the links on the sidebar
